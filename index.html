    <h1>Hai there! I'm Kayla Fakhira</h1>
    <p>I love creating websites that not only look good but also work smoothly.
        From designing layouts with HTML & CSS to adding interactivity with JavaScript, 
        I enjoy the whole process of bringing ideas to life on the web. 
        This portfolio is a collection of the projects I’ve worked on, 
        and I’m excited to share them with you!</p>
